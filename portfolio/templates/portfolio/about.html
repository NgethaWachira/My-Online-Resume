<!-- 		<h1> Hi, I`m James</h1>

		<p>
			A self-motivated Geospatial Engineer and Web Developer with over three yearsâ€™ experience. I have a passion for GIS and IT and its application in a variety of fields. I am proficient with advanced GIS suite of tools and database management systems and also strong knowledge in building models, basic R scripting language, AutoCAD and GIS related software.
		</p>

		<p>
			I have developed my skill set extending my academic qualifications by gaining knowledge in languages such as SQL, HTML5, CSS3, Python and JavaScript as well as with Linux operating systems. 
		</p>

		<p>
			While at ESRI Eastern Africa one of my achievements was successfully configuring a data collection mobile application that was used to report cases of Armyworm infestation in a plantation.
		</p>

		<p>
			In my career I gained great experience as a GIS and Remote sensing assistant in Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development where I gained a strong background in satellite imagery interpretation and extraction of meaningful information from both low and high-resolution images.This influenced my decision to do an undergraduate project in geothermal exploration using Landsat thermal bands.
		</p>
		<p>
			In my experience as an Assistant Cartographer in Geosurv Systems Limited I excelled in using AutoCAD software to an extent where I was promoted taking on the responsibility of training interns in the use and application of AutoCAD in land surveying.
		</p>
		<p>
			I strive continuously to learn new technologies, skills and software platforms/extensions as my passion for GIS makes learning easy and with minimal oversight. As part of my diligence to excellence I possess excellent organizational skills and work ethics.
